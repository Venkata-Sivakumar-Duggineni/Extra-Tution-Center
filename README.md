# Extra-Tution-Center
# Problem Statement

The Extra Tuition Centre (ETC) requires a software system to manage all the bookings for their tutoring services. The system should be able to handle multiple tutors, each specializing in one or more subjects such as English comprehension, English writing, Math, Numerical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, and Non-verbal Reasoning.

The tutors' schedules should be stored in the system, indicating their available time slots for tutoring sessions.

Each student should have a record in the system containing their name, gender, date of birth, emergency contact phone number, and a list of all the lessons they have attended and booked.

All tutoring lessons are one-on-one and have a fixed duration of one hour.

When a student requests a new lesson, they should be able to view the timetable in two ways. They can either specify the tutor's name to view the tutor's schedule, or they can specify the subject they need assistance with to view the schedules of all tutors teaching that subject.

Once the student has viewed the timetables, they should be able to book a lesson at a suitable time slot.

A student should have the ability to change a booking within the same subject before attending the lesson.

Furthermore, a student should be able to cancel a booking before attending the lesson.

After attending a lesson, the student should be able to write a review and provide a numerical rating on a scale of 1 to 5.

At the end of each week, the Extra Tuition Centre needs to generate two reports:

Student Report: This report should list the number of lessons each student has booked, attended, or cancelled during that week.

Tutor Report: This report should list the review comments and ratings for all the lessons taught by each tutor in that week.

The Extra Tuition Centre requires a software solution that efficiently manages the booking process, maintains student records, handles lesson changes and cancellations, enables student reviews, and generates the necessary weekly reports.
